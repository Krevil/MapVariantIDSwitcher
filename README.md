# MapVariantIDSwitcher
A tool for switching Halo Forge Map variant ids

This tool allows users to change a forge map variant file so it can be used on another map, such as a modded version of that map. The only restriction is that the new map should have the same forge palette as the old one, otherwise you can expect to encounter oddities or errors.

I have set the application up so that you can use it with every game in MCC that allows the use of Forge, however I have only tested it with Reach thus far.
